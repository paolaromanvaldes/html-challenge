# html-challenge
Background
This project is designed to further strengthen your web scraping and data analysis skills by exploring Mars-related data. Through the utilization of tools such as Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, you'll engage in two main deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_1_mars_news.ipynb and leverage automated browsing to visit the Mars news site.
Identify relevant elements for scraping using Beautiful Soup.
Extract titles and preview text from news articles, storing results in Python dictionaries with 'title' and 'preview' keys.
Store all dictionaries in a Python list and optionally export the data to a JSON file.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Open the Jupyter Notebook named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb and use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
Identify relevant elements in the HTML table for scraping using Beautiful Soup.
Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with specified column headings.
Examine and convert data types if necessary.
Conduct analysis using Pandas functions to answer specific questions about the dataset.
Plot relevant results as bar charts.
Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
